1. refine requirements

2. use Fake-stream for sending IP camera feed

3. virtual enviroment command:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
deactivate
pip install -r requirements.txt



Backend Connection Design:

Decision:
- Use a single shared socket for all cameras, guarded by a thread lock to enforce sequential access,
  so we avoid concurrency issues.
- Socket auto reconnects with exponential backoff - we have set it to 10 tries, with max delay of 30.

Rationale:
- Avoids managing multiple connections.
- Avoids overwhelming the server with excessive connections.

Known Limitations:
- Potential throughput bottleneck.
- Latency increases if cameras block each other waiting for the lock.

Future Considerations:
- Switch to multiple sockets.
- Learn more about Asyncio as an alternative to threading.
- Consider multiprocessing due to GIL limitations.
- Tune reconnection parameters appropriately.

products_ocr Design:

filtering based on conf level (detail=1) is problematic
because of the printing format of digits on exp dates

finetuning ocr / crnn for exp dates detection
A Generalized Framework for Recognition of Expiration Date on Product Packages
